# Tech Spot

This column is dedicated to my profession as a developer. Last year I finally opened my stand-alone page and I archived my blogs on it for fear of the censorship on China mainland. But it turns out the blog has nothing to do with my own career at the first time. But I have a lot of things to talk about: some knowledge and views I have hold. I hope this column is for my own good -- to have a deeper understanding of the knowledge I have or I believe in so; and helping other rookies like me.
